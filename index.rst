Camera Projection Painter User Manual

Add-on for Blender for working with photo scans and photogrammetry.

History
********

Development began in 2019. Vlad wrote that sometimes there is a need to improve certain areas automatically
textures generated by photogrammetric programs and currently he uses photoshop for this, but it is not convenient, but
a more acceptable option at that time is Substance Painter, it just has a limit for the size of textures, so for him
goals simply do not fit. We discussed for a long time how best to solve the dilemma and decided to implement it with help
Blender drawing mode. It is open source, has a good community of users and is developing quite quickly.

In November 2019, we released the first release of the addon, then it was still called "Scan Paint" and in fact, it was quite
a simple implementation that used object modifiers for object projection, but the basic concepts were preserved.
The main disadvantage of this addon was that it was necessary to export images with distortion, which significantly increased
the number of temporary files on the disk and created additional inconvenience.

In October 2020, Camera Projection Painter 0.1.5 was released, which was implemented in a radically different way,
namely - its main part was written in C++, as a module for Python. This created a significant advantage - was added
automatic distortion of the projected object, faster generation of preview images, faster search
object and image name matches, but this also created a big problem with the distribution and update of the addon.
The problem was that once Blender started using updated versions of the Python ABI, the module was no longer available
use. Also, the problem was that Blender is distributed on different platforms - that is, it should be
assemble the module for each platform separately.

In any case, version 0.1.6 lasted quite a long time (3 years), although it required using an older version
Blender.
