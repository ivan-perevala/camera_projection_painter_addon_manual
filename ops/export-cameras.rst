Export camera data


Calibration Groups
==================

Select to export the information on the created calibration groups

Include Editor Options
======================

Export editor states, e.g. enabled/disabled flags for texturing, meshing, and similar

Export Mode
===========

Depending on how much you trust your registration, you can select the following options or you can also choose not to export camera poses

Do Not Export


Draft
 This will treat poses as an imperfect draft to be optimized in the future. The draft mode functions also as a flight log

Exact
 If you trust the alignment absolutely. By choosing this option, you are saying to the application that poses are precise, but the global position, orientation, and scale is not known

Locked
 This is the same as the exact option with the difference that the camera position and calibration will not be changed, when locked

Calibration Group
=================

By defining a group we state that all images in this group have the same calibration properties, e.g. the same focal length, the same principal point. Use "-1" if you do not want to group the parameters

Distortion Group
================

By defining a group we state that all images in this group have the same lens properties, e.g. the same lens distortion coefficients. Use "-1" if you do not want to group the parameters

In Texturing
============

Whether to use an image to create an object texture

In Meshing
==========

Whether to use an image to create the object mesh data

Forward
=======

 Use the global Z axis as the forward direction

Negative X Forward
 Use the negative global X axis as the forward direction

Negative Y Forward
 Use the negative global Y axis as the forward direction

Negative Z Forward
 Use the negative global Z axis as the forward direction
