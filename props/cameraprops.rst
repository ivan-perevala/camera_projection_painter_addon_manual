Camera
######

Image
=====

Camera binded image. It will be used as a paint brush. Also, its size affects the distortion parameters in the pixel coordinate system (in which way - described in more detail for the corresponding parameters), and therefore - also the possibility of exporting to certain file formats.

Millimeters Focal Length
========================

Camera focal length in millimeters.

Pixels Focal Length
===================

Camera focal length in pixels.

Sensor
======

The size of the camera sensor in millimeters, taking into account the larger side of the binded image.

Millimeters Skew
================

Horizontal camera skew in millimeters.

Pixels Skew
===========

Horizontal camera skew in pixels.

Aspect Ratio
============

Camera aspect ratio correction factor.

Principal X
===========

Deviation of the camera principal point X.

Principal Y
===========

Deviation of the camera principal point Y.

Millimeters Principal X
=======================

Deviation of the camera principal point X in millimeters.

Millimeters Principal Y
=======================

Deviation of the camera principal point Y in millimeters.

Pixels Principal
================

Deviation of the camera principal point in pixels.

Distortion Model
================

Camera mathematical lens distortion model.

None
 No distortion, only correction.

Division
 Division lens distortion model with two radial distortion coefficients.

Polynomial
 Polynomial lens distortion model with four radial and two tangential lens distortion coefficients.

Brown
 Brown-Conrady lens distortion model with four radial and two tangential lens distortion coefficients.

K1
==

First radial coefficient.

K2
==

Second radial coefficient.

K3
==

Third radial coefficient.

K4
